# Hospital-Database-Design-and-Implementation
## Project Overview
This repository contains the **Database Design Implementation** Project for **Amina_MedicalCare** and Medical Management System, Completed by **Amina Ibrahim** in September 2024. The system is designed to efficiently manage hospital data, including patient information , doctor detials, medical records, appointments and department data.

## Introduction
The purpose of this report is to design and implement a fully normalized hospital database system using SQL. The database is structured to manage essential hospital operations such as patient management, doctor scheduling, medical records tracking, and appointment booking. Through proper normalization techniques, the database aims to ensure data integrity, avoid redundancy, and support efficient query execution. The report will document the design process, SQL statements for table creation and population, and queries to retrieve critical hospital information.
